    <p>
      Time is the continuous progression of existence that occurs in an
      apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and
      into the future.123 It is a component quantity of various measurements
      used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events (or the
      intervals between them), and to quantify rates of change of quantities in
      material reality or in the conscious experience.4567 Time is often
      referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.8
    </p>

    <p>
      Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the
      International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities.
      The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the
      electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. General relativity is
      the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works.9 Through
      advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime,
      it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at
      the edges of black holes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout history, time has been an important subject of study in
      religion, philosophy, and science. Temporal measurement has occupied
      scientists and technologists, and has been a prime motivation in
      navigation and astronomy. Time is also of significant social importance,
      having economic value ("time is money") as well as personal value, due to
      an awareness of the limited time in each day ("carpe diem") and in human
      life spans.

    <p>
      The concept of time can be complex. Multiple notions exist, and defining
      time in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has
      consistently eluded scholars.71011 Nevertheless, diverse fields such as
      business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all
      incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring
      systems.121314 Traditional definitions of time involved the observation of
      periodic motion such as the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the
      phases of the moon, and the passage of a free-swinging pendulum. More
      modern systems include the Global Positioning System, other satellite
      systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time. Although these
      systems differ from one another, with careful measurements they can be
      synchronized.
    </p>

    <p>
      In physics, time is a fundamental concept to define other quantities, such
      as velocity. To avoid a circular definition,15 time in physics is
      operationally defined as "what a clock reads", specifically a count of
      repeating events such as the SI second.61617 Although this aids in
      practical measurements, it does not address the essence of time.
      Physicists developed the concept of the spacetime continuum, where events
      are assigned four coordinates: three for space and one for time. Events
      like particle collisions, supernovas, or rocket launches have coordinates
      that may vary for different observers, making concepts like "now" and
      "here" relative. In general relativity, these coordinates do not directly
      correspond to the causal structure of events. Instead, the spacetime
      interval is calculated and classified as either space-like or time-like,
      depending on whether an observer exists that would say the events are
      separated by space or by time.18 Since the time required for light to
      travel a specific distance is the same for all observers—a fact first
      publicly demonstrated by the Michelson–Morley experiment—all observers
      will consistently agree on this definition of time as a causal relation.19
    </p>

    <p>
      General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small
      intervals where quantum mechanics holds. In quantum mechanics, time is
      treated as a universal and absolute parameter, differing from general
      relativity's notion of independent clocks. The problem of time consists of
      reconciling these two theories.20 As of 2025, there is no generally
      accepted theory of quantum general relativity.21

      Methods of temporal measurement, or chronometry, generally take two forms.
      The first is a calendar, a mathematical tool for organising intervals of
      time on Earth,22 consulted for periods longer than a day. The second is a
      clock, a physical mechanism that indicates the passage of time, consulted
      for periods less than a day. The combined measurement marks a specific
      moment in time from a reference point, or epoch.

      Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon
      time as early as 6,000 years ago.23disputed – discuss Lunar calendars were
      among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 lunar months
      (either 354 or 384 days). Without intercalation to add days or months to
      some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve
      lunar months. Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some
      years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be
      about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers
      twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least
      partly due to this relationship of months to years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in
      ancient Mayan civilization, in which they developed the Maya calendar,
      consisting of multiple interrelated calendars. These calendars were
      religiously and astronomically based; the Haab' calendar has 18 months in
      a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at the end of the
      year.24 In conjunction, the Maya also used a 260-day sacred calendar
      called the Tzolk'in.25
    </p>

    <p>
      The reforms of Julius Caesar in 45 BC put the Roman world on a solar
      calendar. This Julian calendar was faulty in that its intercalation still
      allowed the astronomical solstices and equinoxes to advance against it by
      about 11 minutes per year. Pope Gregory XIII introduced a correction in
      1582; the Gregorian calendar was only slowly adopted by different nations
      over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used
      calendar around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the French Revolution, a new clock and calendar were invented as
      part of the dechristianization of France and to create a more rational
      system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The French Republican
      Calendar's days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred
      seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 (duodecimal) system
      used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in
      1806.26

      A large variety of devices have been invented to measure time. The study
      of these devices is called horology.27 They can be driven by a variety of
      means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power,
      and regulated by a variety of means.

      indicate the local time, usually to the hour. The idea to separate the day
      into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials,
      which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is
      due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used
      to count the passage of night.28 Obelisks made as a gnomon were built as
      early as c. 3500 BC.29 An Egyptian device that dates to c. 1500 BC,
      similar in shape to a bent T-square, also measured the passage of time
      from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a nonlinear rule. The T was
      oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around
      so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.30
    </p>

    <p>
      Alarm clocks reportedly first appeared in ancient Greece c. 250 BC with a
      water clock made by Plato that would set off a whistle.31 The hydraulic
      alarm worked by gradually filling a series of vessels with water. After
      some time, the water emptied out of a siphon.32 Inventor Ctesibius revised
      Plato's design; the water clock uses a float as the power drive system and
      uses a sundial to correct the water flow rate.33
    </p>

    <p>
      In medieval philosophical writings, the atom was a unit of time referred
      to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known
      occurrence in English is in Byrhtferth's Enchiridion (a science text) of
      1010–1012,34 where it was defined as 1/564 of a momentum (11⁄2 minutes),35
      and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the computus, the
      process of calculating the date of Easter. The most precise timekeeping
      device of the ancient world was the water clock, or clepsydra, one of
      which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I. They could be
      used to measure the hours even at night but required manual upkeep to
      replenish the flow of water. The ancient Greeks and the people from
      Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping
      records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab
      inventors and engineers, in particular, made improvements on the use of
      water clocks up to the Middle Ages.36 In the 11th century, Chinese
      inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an
      escapement mechanism.A contemporary quartz watch, 2007

      Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in
      temples and churches across the globe. Water clocks, and, later,
      mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and
      monasteries of the Middle Ages. The passage of the hours at sea can also
      be marked by bell. The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at
      sea. Richard of Wallingford (1292–1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey,
      famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical orrery about
      1330.3738 The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.
      They were also used in navigation. Ferdinand Magellan used 18 glasses on
      each ship for his circumnavigation of the globe (1522).39 The English word
      clock probably comes from the Middle Dutch word klocke which, in turn,
      derives from the medieval Latin word clocca, which ultimately derives from
      Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean bell.

    <p>
      Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo Galilei and
      especially Christiaan Huygens with the invention of pendulum-driven clocks
      along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi.40 There is also
      a clock that was designed to keep time for 10,000 years called the Clock
      of the Long Now. Alarm clock devices were later mechanized. Levi
      Hutchins's alarm clock has been credited as the first American alarm
      clock, though it can only ring at 4 a.m. Antoine Redier was also credited
      as the first person to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock in
      1847.41 Digital forms of alarm clocks became more accessible through
      digitization and integration with other technologies, such as smartphones.
      Chip-scale atomic clocks, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected
      to greatly improve GPS location.42
    </p>

    <p>
      The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are
      accurate to seconds in many millions of years,43 and are used to calibrate
      other clocks and timekeeping instruments. Atomic clocks use the frequency
      of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of
      the atoms used is caesium; most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with
      microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.44
      Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of
      time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the
      second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the
      transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of
      the 133Cs atom. A portable timekeeper that meets certain precision
      standards is called a chronometer. Initially, the term was used to refer
      to the marine chronometer, a timepiece used to determine longitude by
      means of celestial navigation, a precision first achieved by John
      Harrison. More recently, the term has also been applied to the chronometer
      watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency
      COSC.

      In modern times, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the
      Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems
      across the globe. As of May 2010, the smallest time interval uncertainty
      in direct measurements is on the order of 12 attoseconds (1.2 × 10−17
      seconds), about 3.7 × 1026 Planck times.45 The time measured was the delay
      caused by out-of-sync electron waves' interference patterns.46

    <p>
      A time standard is a specification for measuring time: assigning a number
      or calendar date to an instant (point in time), quantifying the duration
      of a time interval, and establishing a chronology (ordering of events). In
      modern times, several time specifications have been officially recognized
      as standards, where formerly they were matters of custom and practice. The
      invention in 1955 of the caesium atomic clock has led to the replacement
      of older and purely astronomical time standards such as sidereal time and
      ephemeris time, for most practical purposes, by newer time standards based
      wholly or partly on atomic time using the SI second.
    </p>

    <p>
      International Atomic Time (TAI) is the primary international time standard
      from which other time standards are calculated. Universal Time (UT1) is
      mean solar time at 0° longitude, computed from astronomical observations.
      It varies from TAI because of the irregularities in Earth's rotation.
      Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic time scale designed to
      approximate Universal Time. UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of
      seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of
      one-second steps to UTC, the leap second. The Global Positioning System
      broadcasts a very precise time signal based on UTC time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The surface of the Earth is split into a number of time zones. Standard
      time or civil time in a time zone deviates a fixed, round amount, usually
      a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, usually UTC.
      Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute
      their local time as an offset from UTC. For example, time zones at sea are
      based on UTC. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice
      yearly due to daylight saving time transitions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some other time standards are used mainly for scientific work. Terrestrial
      Time is a theoretical ideal scale realized by TAI. Geocentric Coordinate
      Time and Barycentric Coordinate Time are scales defined as coordinate
      times in the context of the general theory of relativity, with TCG
      applying to Earth's center and TCB to the solar system's barycenter.
      Barycentric Dynamical Time is an older relativistic scale related to TCB
      that is still in use.

      Many ancient cultures, particularly in the East, had a cyclical view of
      time. In these traditions, time was often seen as a recurring pattern of
      ages or cycles, where events and phenomena repeated themselves in a
      predictable manner. One of the most famous examples of this concept is
      found in Hindu philosophy, where time is depicted as a wheel called the
      "Kalachakra" or "Wheel of Time." According to this belief, the universe
      undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.47
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, in other ancient cultures such as those of the Mayans, Aztecs,
      and Chinese, there were also beliefs in cyclical time, often associated
      with astronomical observations and calendars.48 These cultures developed
      complex systems to track time, seasons, and celestial movements,
      reflecting their understanding of cyclical patterns in nature and the
      universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cyclical view of time contrasts with the linear concept of time more
      common in Western thought, where time is seen as progressing in a straight
      line from past to future without repetition.49

      In general, the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world-view regards time as

      traditional Christian view sees time ending, teleologically,52 with the
      eschatological end of the present order of things, the "end time". Though
      some Christian theologians (such as Augustine of Hippo and Aquinas53)
      believe that God is outside of time, seeing all events simultaneously,
      that time did not exist before God, and that God created time.5455

      The phenomenal world, including time, is seen as impermanent and
      characterized by plurality, suffering, conflict, and division. Since
      phenomenal existence is dominated by temporality (kala), everything within
      time is subject to change and decay. Overcoming pain and death requires

      Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers. One view
      is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe—a
      dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac
      Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred
      to as Newtonian time.6364
    </p>

    <p>
      The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container"
      that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows",
      but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure
      (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare
      events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz16 and
      Immanuel Kant,6566 holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and
      thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled. Furthermore, it may
      be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time
      itself is "felt", as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a matter of
      debate.2676768

      In philosophy, time was questioned throughout the centuries; what time is
      and if it is real or not. Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was
      linear or cyclical and if time was endless or finite.69 These philosophers
      had different ways of explaining time; for instance, ancient Indian
      philosophers had something called the Wheel of Time. It is believed that
      there was repeating ages over the lifespan of the universe.70 This led to
      beliefs like cycles of rebirth and reincarnation.70 The Greek philosophers
      believe that the universe was infinite, and was an illusion to humans.70
      Plato believed that time was made by the Creator at the same instant as
      the heavens.70 He also says that time is a period of motion of the
      heavenly bodies.70 Aristotle believed that time correlated to movement,
      that time did not exist on its own but was relative to motion of
      objects.70 He also believed that time was related to the motion of
      celestial bodies; the reason that humans can tell time was because of
      orbital periods and therefore there was a duration on time.71

    <p>
      Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers. One view
      is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe—a
      dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac
      Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred
      to as Newtonian time.6364
    </p>

    <p>
      The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container"
      that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows",
      but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure
      (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare
      events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz16 and
      Immanuel Kant,6566 holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and
      thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled. Furthermore, it may
      be that there is a subjective component to time, but whether or not time

      The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy
      dating to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in
      which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction
      and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320 million years.72 Ancient Greek
      philosophers, including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the
      nature of time.73 Plato, in the Timaeus, identified time with the period
      of motion of the heavenly bodies. Aristotle, in Book IV of his Physica
      defined time as 'number of movement in respect of the before and after'.74
      In Book 11 of his Confessions, St. Augustine of Hippo ruminates on the
      nature of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if
      I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not." He begins to define
      time by what it is not rather than what it is,75 an approach similar to
      that taken in other negative definitions. However, Augustine ends up
      calling time a "distention" of the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we
      simultaneously grasp the past in memory, the present by attention, and the
      future by expectation.

      Philosophers in the 17th and 18th century questioned if time was real and
      absolute, or if it was an intellectual concept that humans use to
      understand and sequence events.69 These questions lead to realism vs
      anti-realism; the realists believed that time is a fundamental part of the
      universe, and be perceived by events happening in a sequence, in a
      dimension.76 Isaac Newton said that we are merely occupying time, he also
      says that humans can only understand relative time.76 Isaac Newton
      believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed that time
      and space are relational.77 The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's
      interpretations came to a head in the famous Leibniz–Clarke
      correspondence. Relative time is a measurement of objects in motion.76 The
      anti-realists believed that time is merely a convenient intellectual
      concept for humans to understand events.76 This means that time was
      useless unless there were objects that it could interact with, this was
      called relational time.76 René Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume said
      that one's mind needs to acknowledge time, in order to understand what
      time is.71 Immanuel Kant believed that we can not know what something is
      unless we experience it first hand.78

      Time is not an empirical concept. For neither co-existence nor succession
      would be perceived by us, if the representation of time did not exist as a
      foundation a priori. Without this presupposition, we could not represent
      to ourselves that things exist together at one and the same time, or at
      different times, that is, contemporaneously, or in succession.

      Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a
      priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori
      intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience.79 With Kant, neither
      space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements
      of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the
      experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject. Kant thought of
      time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together
      with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their
      duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, time does not
      refer to any kind of entity that "flows," that objects "move through," or
      that is a "container" for events. Spatial measurements are used to
      quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal
      measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events.
      Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure
      concept or category.

    <p>
      Henri Bergson believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor
      a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as Duration.
      Duration, in Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential
      component of reality.80
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time.
      Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been,
      which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the
      future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or
      engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being
      concerned, which causes "being ahead of oneself" when thinking of a
      pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence
      also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an
      experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems
      to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal
      existence, is broken or transcended.81 We are not stuck in sequential
      time. We are able to remember the past and project into the future; we
      have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence;
      we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.82
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern era philosophers asked: is time real or unreal, is time happening
      all at once or a duration, is time tensed or tenseless, and is there a
      future to be?69 There is a theory called the tenseless or B-theory; this
      theory says that any tensed terminology can be replaced with tenseless
      terminology.83 For example, "we will win the game" can be replaced with
      "we do win the game", taking out the future tense. On the other hand,
      there is a theory called the tense or A-theory; this theory says that our
      language has tense verbs for a reason and that the future can not be
      determined.83 There is also something called imaginary time, this was from
      Stephen Hawking, who said that space and imaginary time are finite but
      have no boundaries.83 Imaginary time is not real or unreal, it is
      something that is hard to visualize.83 Philosophers can agree that
      physical time exists outside of the human mind and is objective, and
      psychological time is mind-dependent and subjective.71

      In 5th century BC Greece, Antiphon the Sophist, in a fragment preserved
      from his chief work On Truth, held that: "Time is not a reality
      (hypostasis), but a concept (noêma) or a measure (metron)." Parmenides
      went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions,
      leading to the paradoxes of his follower Zeno.84 Time as an illusion is
      also a common theme in Buddhist thought.8586
    </p>

    <p>
      These arguments often center on what it means for something to be unreal.
      Modern physicists generally believe that time is as real as space—though
      others, such as Julian Barbour, argue quantum equations of the universe
      take their true form when expressed in the timeless realm containing every
      possible now or momentary configuration of the universe.87 J. M. E.
      McTaggart's 1908 article The Unreality of Time argues that, since every
      event has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e.,
      future or past), that time is a self-contradictory idea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another modern philosophical theory called presentism views the past and
      the future as human-mind interpretations of movement instead of real parts
      of time (or "dimensions") which coexist with the present. This theory
      rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the
      future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the
      philosophical arguments against time travel.88 This contrasts with
      eternalism (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the growing
      block theory (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).

      >Until Einstein's reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated
      with time and space in 1907, time was considered to be the same everywhere
      in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for
      any event.89 Non-relativistic classical mechanics is based on this
      Newtonian idea of time. Einstein, in his special theory of relativity,90
      postulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all
      observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable
      definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires
      that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for
      events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.

      of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski
      spacetime, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of
      space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in
      space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance,
      e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in
      terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in
      Minkowski spacetime are separated by an invariant interval, which can be
      either space-like, light-like, or time-like. Events that have a time-like
      separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there must be
      a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation.
      Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some
      frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do
      not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different
      distances and different time intervals between two events, but the
      invariant interval between the events is independent of the observer and
      their velocity.

      Unlike space, where an object can travel in the opposite directions (and
      in 3 dimensions), time appears to have only one dimension and only one
      direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies
      ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet most laws of physics allow any
      process to proceed both forward and in reverse. There are only a few
      physical phenomena that violate the reversibility of time. This time
      directionality is known as the arrow of time.
